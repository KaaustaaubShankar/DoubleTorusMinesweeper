So we work out section 1 ,the topmost one, using points as a way to make triangle primtives. 

We can calculate the points using zigzag method relying on sides

Fill in values for that section and copy it 7 more times

Run through lst from boardsetup and fill in triangles with appropriate color

Think about how to fill up triangle object with numbers

how many mines are next to it. We also now have a method for showing which neighbors are marked as empty tiles
