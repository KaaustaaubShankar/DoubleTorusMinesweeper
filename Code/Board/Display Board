So we work out section 1 ,the topmost one, using points as a way to make triangle primtives. 

We can calculate the points using zigzag method relying on sides

Fill in values for that section and copy it 7 more times

Run through lst from boardsetup and fill in triangles with appropriate color

Think about how to fill up triangle object with numbers

We have sectioned out the octagan so thats good. We have also added numbers to the numbered tiles signifyfing on 
how many mines are next to it. We also now have a method for showing which neighbors are marked as empty tiles

We now have tokens to for all of our indexes and values to make our code a little bit easier to change and readable.
We are planning on getting rid of the extra lists since they are independent of whether it is a mine or not.
We now have to get rid of the 0's in the mines and implement the torus neighbor detection which should be real quick
We also have to add mines that dont have text sine they dont have texts and the reveal token
