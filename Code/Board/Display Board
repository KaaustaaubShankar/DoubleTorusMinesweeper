So we work out section 1 ,the topmost one, using points as a way to make triangle primtives. 

We can calculate the points using zigzag method relying on sides

Fill in values for that section and copy it 7 more times

Run through lst from boardsetup and fill in triangles with appropriate color

Think about how to fill up triangle object with numbers
